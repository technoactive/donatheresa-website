# Last Order Time & Kitchen Closing Time Implementation

## Overview
Added **Last Order Time** and **Kitchen Closing Time** fields to each service period in the booking system. This allows restaurants to control when customers can make their final bookings vs. when the kitchen actually closes.

## ✅ Implementation Completed

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- **File:** `scripts/add-last-order-kitchen-closing-times.sql`
- Added `last_order_time` and `kitchen_closing_time` columns to `service_periods` table
- Added constraint to ensure logical time ordering: `start_time < last_order_time <= kitchen_closing_time <= end_time`
- Updated all database functions to handle the new fields

### 2. Backend Updates
- **Files:** `lib/types.ts`, `lib/database.ts`
- Updated `ServicePeriod` interface to include new fields
- Modified `getServicePeriods()` function to return new fields
- Updated `upsertServicePeriod()` function to handle new fields
- Modified `generate_time_slots_from_periods()` to use `last_order_time` instead of `end_time`

### 3. Frontend Updates
- **File:** `app/dashboard/settings/bookings/page.tsx`
- Added `lastOrderTime` and `kitchenClosingTime` to `ServicePeriodFrontend` interface
- Updated UI to include input fields for both new times
- Modified time slot generation logic to use last order time
- Added helpful descriptions for each time field

### 4. Migration & Testing
- **File:** `scripts/test-last-order-implementation.js`
- Created migration script to add columns and set default values
- Built comprehensive test suite to verify implementation
- Tested multiple scenarios with different time configurations

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### For Restaurant Operations
- **Kitchen Buffer Time**: Kitchen closes after last order time, allowing proper preparation
- **Clear Boundaries**: Distinct times for booking cutoff vs. service end
- **Flexible Configuration**: Different settings per service period (lunch, dinner, etc.)
- **Operational Control**: Prevents last-minute bookings when kitchen is winding down

### For Customers
- **Transparent Booking**: Clear understanding of when bookings are available
- **Realistic Expectations**: No more late bookings that stress the kitchen
- **Better Service**: Kitchen has adequate time to prepare meals

## 📋 Time Fields Explanation

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Start Time** | When service period begins | 12:00 |
| **Last Order Time** | Final booking acceptance time | 14:30 |
| **Kitchen Closing Time** | When kitchen stops operations | 15:00 |
| **End Time** | When service period officially ends | 15:30 |

## 🔄 Time Slot Generation Logic

### Before Implementation
```
Time slots: Start Time → End Time
Example: 12:00 → 15:00 = [12:00, 12:30, 13:00, 13:30, 14:00, 14:30]
```

### After Implementation
```
Time slots: Start Time → Last Order Time (inclusive)
Example: 12:00 → 14:30 = [12:00, 12:30, 13:00, 13:30, 14:00, 14:30]
```

## 📊 Example Configuration

### Lunch Service
- **Start Time**: 12:00
- **Last Order Time**: 14:30 ⭐ (Customers can book until this time)
- **Kitchen Closing Time**: 15:00 (Kitchen finishes cooking)
- **End Time**: 15:30 (Service period ends)
- **Available Slots**: 12:00, 12:30, 13:00, 13:30, 14:00, 14:30

### Dinner Service
- **Start Time**: 18:00
- **Last Order Time**: 21:30 ⭐ (Customers can book until this time)
- **Kitchen Closing Time**: 22:00 (Kitchen finishes cooking)
- **End Time**: 22:30 (Service period ends)
- **Available Slots**: 18:00, 18:30, 19:00, 19:30, 20:00, 20:30, 21:00, 21:30

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Run the Migration
```sql
-- Execute this in Supabase SQL Editor
\i scripts/add-last-order-kitchen-closing-times.sql
```

### 2. Configure Service Periods
1. Go to **Dashboard → Settings → Bookings**
2. Edit each service period
3. Set the **Last Order Time** (when bookings close)
4. Set the **Kitchen Closing Time** (when kitchen closes)
5. Save settings

### 3. Test the Implementation
```bash
node scripts/test-last-order-implementation.js
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Functions Updated
- `get_service_periods()` - Returns new time fields
- `upsert_service_period()` - Handles new fields in inserts/updates
- `generate_time_slots_from_periods()` - Uses last_order_time for slot generation

### Frontend Changes
- Service period configuration form includes new time inputs
- Time slot generation uses last order time instead of end time
- Validation ensures logical time ordering

## 📈 Impact

### Restaurant Benefits
- ✅ Better kitchen workflow management
- ✅ Reduced last-minute booking stress
- ✅ Clear operational boundaries
- ✅ Improved service quality

### Customer Benefits
- ✅ Transparent booking windows
