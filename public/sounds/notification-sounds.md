# Notification Sound Files

The notification system expects these sound files:

## Required Files:
- `new-booking.mp3` - For new bookings
- `vip-booking.mp3` - For VIP customers  
- `booking-cancelled.mp3` - For cancellations
- `peak-time.mp3` - For peak time alerts
- `system-alert.mp3` - For system alerts

## Quick Solution:
You can download free notification sounds from:

- Use short (1-2 second) notification sounds

## Or use the fallback system sound in the code:
The notification system will fallback to a programmatic beep if files are missing.
