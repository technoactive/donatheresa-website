# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Booking Action Buttons Restored

## What Was Broken
- The "View" button didn't do anything
- No way to edit bookings
- No way to confirm/cancel bookings
- Lost all booking management functionality

## What's Fixed Now

### Action Buttons (Appear on Hover)
When you hover over any booking in the "All Upcoming" view, you'll see:

1. **✏️ Edit Button** (Pencil icon)
   - Click to edit booking details
   - Opens edit dialog with all booking information
   - Can modify date, time, party size, notes, etc.

2. **✓ Confirm Button** (Green checkmark)
   - Click to confirm a pending booking
   - Only shows if booking is not already confirmed

3. **🕐 Pending Button** (Yellow clock)
   - Click to set booking back to pending
   - Only shows if booking is not already pending

4. **✕ Cancel Button** (Red X)
   - Click to cancel a booking
   - Only shows if booking is not already cancelled

## How to Use

1. Go to Bookings page
2. In the "All Upcoming" tab, find your booking
3. Hover over the booking row
4. Action buttons appear on the right
5. Click the appropriate button:
   - **Edit**: Modify any booking details
   - **Confirm**: Accept a pending booking
   - **Cancel**: Cancel a booking
   - **Pending**: Set back to pending status
