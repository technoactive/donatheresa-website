# Notification System Fixes

## Toast Notification Display Fix
**Date:** January 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Toast notifications not displaying visually despite system working correctly  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Problem Description
The notification system was functioning correctly:
- ‚úÖ Notifications were being created successfully  
- ‚úÖ Sounds were playing properly
- ‚úÖ Real-time subscriptions were active
- ‚úÖ Notification center was updating

However, users could not see **visual toast notifications** appearing on screen.

### Root Cause
Database settings analysis revealed that while the core notification system was enabled, the specific **toast display settings** were disabled:

- `show_toasts`: was disabled
- Individual `*_toast` settings (e.g., `new_booking_toast`, `system_alert_toast`) were disabled

### Solution Applied
Updated the `notification_settings` table via SQL query to enable all toast display options:

```sql
UPDATE notification_settings 
SET 
  show_toasts = true,
  new_booking_toast = true,
  system_alert_toast = true,
  vip_booking_toast = true,
  booking_cancelled_toast = true,
  booking_updated_toast = true,
  peak_time_booking_toast = true,
  customer_message_toast = true,
  
  -- Also ensured base notification types are enabled
  notifications_enabled = true,
  new_booking_enabled = true,
  system_alert_enabled = true,
  vip_booking_enabled = true,
  booking_cancelled_enabled = true,
  booking_updated_enabled = true,
  peak_time_booking_enabled = true,
  customer_message_enabled = true,
  sound_enabled = true,
  
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE user_id = 'admin';
```

### Result
‚úÖ **Complete notification system now working:**
- üîä Sound notifications (already working)
- üçû Visual toast notifications (now fixed)
- üîî Notification center updates  
- üì± All notification types functional

### Verification
Users can now test the complete notification system using the debug panel and will see:
1. Visual toast notifications appearing in the top-right corner
2. Audio feedback for appropriate notification types  
3. Real-time updates in the notification center
4. Proper notification filtering and display

### Technical Notes
The notification system uses a two-level permission system:
1. **Global setting**: `show_toasts` - enables/disables all toast notifications
2. **Type-specific settings**: `[type]_toast` - enables/disables individual notification types

Both levels must be enabled for toast notifications to display properly.
