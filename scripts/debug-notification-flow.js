Please open your browser console and check the following:

1. When you create a booking from the PUBLIC website:
   - Look for: "🆕 New booking detected:"
   - Look for: "🔔 Creating notification:"
   - Look for: "✅ Notification added successfully"
   - Look for: "📥 Notifications updated:"

2. Check the NotificationManager logs:
   - Look for: "📝 Adding notification:"
   - Look for: "✅ Creating notification:"
   - Look for: "📊 Total notifications now:"
   - Look for: "💾 Saving notification to database:"

3. Check the real-time subscription:
   - Look for: "📡 Realtime subscription status: SUBSCRIBED"
   - Look for: "�� New notification inserted:"

4. Check the NotificationProvider:
   - Look for: "🔄 Loading initial notifications:"
   - Look for: "📥 Notifications updated:"
   - Look for: "📬 Unread notifications:"

Common issues:
- If you see "⏭️ Skipping dashboard-created booking" - the booking source might be wrong
- If you see "❌ Notification blocked by settings" - check notification settings
- If you don't see any logs - the components might not be mounted
