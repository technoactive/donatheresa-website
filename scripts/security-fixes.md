# Security Fixes Applied

## Notification Settings Security Hardening

**Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Migration:** `fix_notification_settings_security`

### Issues Resolved

#### 1. RLS Disabled in Public Schema
**Issue:** Table `public.notification_settings` was public, but RLS had not been enabled.  
**Severity:** ERROR  
**Category:** SECURITY

**Fix Applied:**
- Enabled Row Level Security (RLS) on `notification_settings` table
- Created secure RLS policies:
  - `Admin can view own notification settings` - SELECT policy for admin user
  - `Admin can update own notification settings` - UPDATE policy for admin user  
  - `Admin can insert own notification settings` - INSERT policy for admin user
- All policies restrict access to `user_id = 'admin'` only

#### 2. Function Search Path Mutable
**Issue:** Function `public.update_notification_settings_updated_at` had a role mutable search_path  
**Severity:** WARN  
**Category:** SECURITY

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated function with `SECURITY DEFINER` and explicit `SET search_path = public`
- Prevents potential SQL injection through search_path manipulation
- Recreated trigger to use the hardened function

### Security Verification

✅ **RLS Policies Active:** All notification settings access properly restricted  
✅ **Function Hardened:** Search path locked to public schema  
✅ **Admin Access:** Confirmed working for authorized user  
✅ **Data Integrity:** All existing settings preserved  

### Post-Fix Status

- **Security Advisors:** No security warnings remaining
- **System Functionality:** All notification features working normally
- **Database Performance:** No impact on query performance
- **User Experience:** No changes to application behavior

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** RLS policies ensure users can only access their own data
2. **Defense in Depth:** Function security prevents search_path attacks
3. **Data Protection:** Settings are isolated per user account
4. **Audit Trail:** All security changes documented and versioned
